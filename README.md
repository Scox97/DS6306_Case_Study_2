MSDS 6306 Case Study 2
Author: Steven Cox

DDSAnalytics is a Fortune 100 company that has hired me to analyze employee attrition based on a companies research. My objective is to identify the top three factors that contribute to employee turnover within DDSAnalytics, and also to examine any job role specific trends that may exist in the data set.

To achieve this, a thorough analysis of the available employee data. This will likely involve cleaning and pre-processing the data, creating derived attributes/variables/features where necessary, and then applying appropriate statistical or machine learning techniques to identify the key factors contributing to turnover.

Once the top three factors have been identified, we can then examine whether there are any job role specific trends that may be contributing to these factors. This could involve looking at differences in turnover rates between job roles, or examining employee satisfaction levels within each role to identify areas that may require improvement. Overall, the goal is to provide DDSAnalytics with actionable insights that can help reduce employee turnover and improve talent management practices.
